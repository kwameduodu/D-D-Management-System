# D-D-Management-System

The goal of the D&D Management System is to simplify the process of creating and managing character sheets for Dungeons and Dragons ("D&D"), with the goal of making it more user-friendly and accessible. The D&D Management System will allow each player to create and update their own character sheets, which include spell lists and inventory, throughout their game. The Dungeon Master ("DM") will be able to view all the character sheets to make it easier to manage the game, as well as have their own custom sheets for notes, non-player characters ("NPC"s), and monsters the players will encounter. This application utilizes an external API to access the officially released Systems Reference Document content and also allows users to create their own custom ("homebrew") content.
